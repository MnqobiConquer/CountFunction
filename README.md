CountFunction Console App

Overview:
CountFunction is a simple C# console application that takes a list of various data types (strings, integers, doubles, etc.) and counts the number of times each unique item appears in the list. It then prints the results to the console.

This project demonstrates:

Use of collections (List<object> and Dictionary<object, int>)

Type handling using object

Basic iteration and conditional logic

Console output formatting

Technologies Used:
Language: C#

Framework: .NET (Console Application)

IDE: Visual Studio 2022 or any C# compatible IDE

How It Works:
A list of items is initialized with mixed types (strings, numbers).

The CountItems function counts how many times each unique item appears.
